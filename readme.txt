Disable sidebar and dashboard widgets with an easy to use interface.

== Description ==
This simple plugin allows you to disable any sidebar and dashboard widget for the current WordPress site you are on. It provides a simple user interface available to users with `edit_theme_options` capabilities (usually Administrator role) available under Appearance -> Disable Widgets.
After saving the settings, it removes the Sidebar and Dashboard Widgets selected.

**Developer? Get to know the hooks**

Let’s have a look at the filters we provide:

* `rplus_wp_widget_disable_capability`: Change the required capability for disabling widgets. Defaults to `edit_theme_options`.
* `rplus_wp_widget_disable_default_sidebar_filter`: Lets you change the list of all sidebar widgets before we store them, so you could basically exclude sidebar widgets from being disabled by the plugin.
* `rplus_wp_widget_disable_default_dashboard_filter`: Lets you change the list of all dashboard widgets before we store them, so you could basically exclude dashboard widgets from being disabled by the plugin.
